            <p>India has witnessed a high demand for Government jobs for many
                decades. People prefer Government jobs as their career option
                considering the wide variety of benefits that are associated
                with these. ‘Sarkari Naukri’ is a dream for millions of people
                across the nation, and only a few are lucky to land up with such
                jobs. People tend to take pride in having a Sarkari or
                Government job.<br><br><br>Government jobs hold the kind of
                authority not found in private jobs. These also offer job
                security for a lifetime, and hence a lot of youth prefer them.
                Getting into a Government job requires a person to go through
                multiple levels of tests. These include a written examination,
                interview and sometimes even physical examination. These are
                competitive exams, and millions of people appear for these exams
                to get into a coveted Government job.</p><br><br><br>
            <h2>How Competitive Is the Government Job Market?</h2><br><br><br>
            <p>There is no doubt that finding an Indian government job is highly
                competitive. The Times of India said it best when they said that
                the numbers are staggering:</p><br><br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Important Dates</li>

                <li>Education Eligibility</li>
            </ul><br><br><br>
            <p>With COVID-19, the competition has only increased because of the
                drop in the number of people hired by the government. The
                central government hired 119,000 people in 2021 which is a
                reduction in almost 32,000 jobs. There was a similar drop in
                2021 of almost 107,000 people hired by the state government.
                This creates an extremely competitive environment. Getting
                up-to-date information on the latest jobs on Sarkari Result and
                understanding eligibility requirements can help you stand out
